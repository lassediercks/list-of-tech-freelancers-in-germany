## Reasoning

I think we (freelancer & client) work better when we talk directly to each other to see if we're the right fit for the job. This is a list I want to point to when someone asks me "if I know someone who can do x"

I generally believe exposure is good as a freelancer that's why I did not ask anyone if I am allowed to put them here. 

## Changes

If you feel like your name is missing on this list or you don't want yours on it.
