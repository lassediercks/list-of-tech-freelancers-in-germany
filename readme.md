* FE - Frontend
* SEO - Search Engine Optimization
* UI - User Interaction
* UX - User Experience

## Reasoning

I think we (freelancer & client) work better when we talk directly to each other to see if we're the right fit for the job. This is a list I want to point to when someone asks me "if I know someone who can do x"

I generally believe exposure is good as a freelancer that's why I did not ask anyone if I am allowed to put them here.
